# 🌍 WorldWise

**WorldWise** is my first project using **React Router**. It's a simple travel tracker app that allows users to mark cities they've visited on a map and store related information about each location.

## 🚀 Features

- Multi-page navigation using **React Router v6**
- Interactive map powered by **Leaflet**
- Add cities by clicking on the map
- View a list of visited cities with descriptions
- Minimal, responsive UI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**
- **React Router v6**
- **Leaflet.js** for the map
- **CSS Modules** / plain CSS for styling

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cristian049/WorldWise.git
   cd WorldWise
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
